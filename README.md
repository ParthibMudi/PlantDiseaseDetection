Plant Disease Detection Project in Python
Introduction
The Plant Disease Detection project is an innovative solution aimed at identifying and diagnosing diseases in plants using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques. Developed in Python, this project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze plant images and accurately detect various diseases, providing farmers and agriculturists with a powerful tool to manage plant health.

Key Features
1. Image Preprocessing
Image Augmentation: Enhances the training dataset by applying transformations like rotation, scaling, and flipping to create variations of the input images.
Normalization: Ensures the input images have a consistent scale and range, improving the model's performance.
2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Model Architecture: A deep CNN architecture is designed to learn and extract features from plant images.
Training: The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled plant images to recognize patterns associated with different diseases.
Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
3. Plant Disease Detection
Disease Classification: The trained model classifies input images into various disease categories or healthy plants.
Confidence Scores: Provides confidence scores for each classification, indicating the model's certainty.
4. User Interface
Streamlit Integration: The project uses Streamlit to create an interactive web application where users can upload images and receive disease diagnoses.
Real-time Feedback: Users receive immediate feedback on the health status of their plants.
5. Dataset
Kaggle Dataset: Utilizes a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle containing images of healthy and diseased plants across various species.
Data Split: The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.
